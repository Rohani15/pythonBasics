# type of data structure/ container that sores values

coordinates = (4, 5) # tuples with coordinates inside of it
# tuples are immutable ==> cant be changed or modified once created
print(coordinates[0]) # will print 4

# difference between tuples and a list-------------------------------
# can change lists
# use tuples for data that never change like coordinates
